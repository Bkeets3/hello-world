#hello-world

Hey everyone!

My name is Blake, aka bkeets3, and I'm currently a self taught programmer. I'm 24 years old, and have worked for one company in retail since the age of 14. I was never good at school, but always had an interest in computers. This 2019 I'm taking the initiative to teach myself something thats always had my interest. I plan on starting with html/css and working myself up to Javascript.
